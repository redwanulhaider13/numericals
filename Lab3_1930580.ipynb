        "1. Area\n",
        "2. Perimeter\n",

The class labels are encoded as  1, 2, and 3 for Kama, Rosa, and Canadian, respectively. The goal of this assignment is to build a classifier that can predict the type of wheat seed based on the measurements of the seed. Follow the instructions below to complete the assignment."

        "2. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive and mount your Google Drive to Colab.\n",
        "3. Read the dataset using numpy's built-in function `np.genfromtxt()`. Pass the following parameters to the function:\n",
        "    - `fname`: The path to the dataset\n",

Use numpy's array slicing to split the dataset into features and labels.

        "    - `indices_or_sections`: The number of instances in the training set (Hint: Use `int(0.8 * len(dataset))` to get the number of instances in the training set)\n",
        "    - `axis`: The axis to split the dataset (Hint: Use `0` to split the dataset along the rows)\n",
        "7. Find the minimum and maximum values of each feature in the training set. Use numpy's built-in function `np.min()` and `np.max()` to find the minimum and maximum values of each feature in the training set. Pass the following parameters to the function:\n",

If the features are not normalized, the higher-valued features will outnumber the lower-valued ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "    For example, suppose we have a dataset with two features: the number of bedrooms in a house and the size of the garden in square feet and we are trying to forecast the rent of the residence. If the features are not normalized, the feature with higher values will take precedence over the feature with lower values. In this scenario, the garden area has a greater value. As a result, the model will make an attempt to forecast the house's price depending on the size of the garden. As a consequence, the model will be faulty since most individuals will not pay higher rent for more garden area. We need to normalize the features in order to prevent this. Let's look at the following illustration to better comprehend what we have said:\n",

        "    - House 3: 7 bedrooms, 2300 sq. ft. garden\n",
        "\n",
        "    Considering that most people won't pay more for a larger garden, it follows that the rent for House 1 should be more comparable to House 2 than to House 3. However, if we give the aforementioned data to a k-NN classifier without normalization, it will compute the euclidean distance between the test and training examples and pick the class of the test instance based on the class of the closest training instance.\n",

        "    - Distance between house 1 and house 2: $\\sqrt{(2-3)^2 + (2500-500)^2} = 2000$\n",

This is not what was anticipated. We need to normalize the features in order to prevent this. To normalize the features, subtract the minimum value of each feature from all the values of that feature and divide the result by the range of the feature. The range of a feature is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of that feature. The formula for normalization is given below:\n",

The minimum and maximum values of the number of bedrooms are 2 and 7, respectively. The minimum and maximum values of the garden area are 500 and 2500, respectively. The normalized values of the features are given below:\n",

        "\n",
        "    As you can see now, the distance between houses 1 and 2 is shorter than that between houses 1 and 3. The model will thus forecast that house 1 will cost about the same as house 2, according to the prediction. This is what is anticipated. This is what normalization does. It equalizes the scale of all features. This is important because it prevents the features with higher values from dominating the features with lower values.\n",
